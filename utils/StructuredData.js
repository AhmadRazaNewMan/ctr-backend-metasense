Your response would always be the numeric value with no units added and we would assume these are base units for example: If the value is in tons, we would assume GPT as give us metric tons value. If in the context data the value is in Ktons, convert it to metric tons by using appropriate calculations (e.g., multiply ktons by 1000 to convert to metric tons) and return us the value. If the unit is not provided, assume itâ€™s base unit.
